This project was born out of my personal experience with traditional language learning apps. I realized I was only opening them to maintain my daily streak. My free time was spent reading articles, newsletters, and content on sites like Substack, Medium, and Wikipedia.
The core inspiration was: if I could integrate the learning process directly into my existing browsing habits, i could learn new words on the go!

## What it does
anuvad is a chrome extension that fits into user's everyday browsing making it in place contextual language practice. With a single click, it selects a random from the webpage article and marks it with a dashed underline.
When the user hovers over the underlined word, a pop-up instantly appears with the translation of the word.
